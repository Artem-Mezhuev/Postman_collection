In the framework of studying Postman and API I had to perform the following task :

- As part of the assignment, you need to test all the methods presented for the https://petstore.swaggerio/ service in Postman and create the corresponding collections.
- Be sure to use variables in Postman
In addition to creating a collection by all methods you also need:
- Write a test that checks the status code after removing the pet from the database
- Create multiple users using createdWithArray
- In the request body to create a pet make dynamic values that will be automatically generated when you send
